# **Real-Time System Design Projects**

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on **real-time system design**. These projects demonstrate the implementation of **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** and **WebSockets**, showcasing how to build systems capable of handling real-time communication in distributed architectures.

The repository is intended to support exercises related to system design, including **Live Comment System Design**, **Distributed Counter System**, and other real-world scenarios.

## **Contents**

- **Technologies Used**
    - **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: For one-way communication from servers to clients.
    - **WebSockets**: For full-duplex communication between servers and clients.

- **Projects**
    - Real-world examples of system design, such as:
        - **Live Comment System Design**: A system to handle live comments or chat in real time.
        - **Distributed Counter System**: A scalable counter updated across multiple clients.

- **Multi-Language Support**
    - Projects implemented in multiple languages, including **Go**, **Python**, **Node.js**, and others.

- **Documentation**
    - Guides for understanding and implementing real-time communication patterns.
